**CHATBOT PROGRAM**

This program is meant to be a simple chatbot capable of 30 rounds of semi-natural speech. This was initally done via simple phrase recognition but has been upgraded to use python's natural language toolkit. Implemented features include:

- Misspelling handling via Porter Stemmer.
> Program stems user input and checks against stemmed sentences on the backend, allowing the system to handle minor gramatical errors.

- Part of Speech recognition.
> In order to make sure the user is giving a valid name or food item, the system checks for a noun when asking for user input for stored values.

- Named entity recognition.
> Similar to the POS recognition, the program uses NER to isolate the name of an organization from a string when the user inputs a response to a question like 'What is your favorite hockey team?"

- A simple GUI via Python's Tkinter functionality.
> The title explains it pretty well, this allows the user to input conversation in a more standard setting. This also allows the user to look back through chat history.

- More varried responses when the agent doesn't understand.
> In order to make the program a bit more dynamic, it can now randomly pick from one of five error sentences instead of just the one.

- Use of Public APIs 
 
 -Wikipedia API
  >Robot Robert uses the Wikipedia API (https://pypi.org/project/wikipedia/) which makes it easy to access and parse data from Wikipedia.
 
 -GoogleTranslate API 
  >Robot Robert uses the Google Translate API (https://pypi.org/project/googletrans2/) that implemented Google Translate API and converts English to Japanese.
